# go-mach

A Go interface to the user-space API of the Mach kernel that underlies macOS and is linked via `libSystem`.

This package is inspired by the implementation of [golang.org/x/sys](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/sys) package and [The Go programming Language](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go) sources.
